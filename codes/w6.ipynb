        "# What is Object Oriented Programming?\n",
        "It is just one approach out of many approaches to writing software. In Object-Oriented Programming you use classes as representation of real-world objects and situations and you create objects which are called instances of these classes. Generally you can think of class as a blueprint and object/instance as a house built out of the blueprint. \n",
        "\n",
        "When writing a class you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. You can set unique properties for each object and these will be modeled after real world situations. \n",
        "\n",
        "Creating an object is called instantations. We will create classes and make instances of them. When writing a classes you will define which kind of informatino can be stored in instances and you'll define actions that can be done with these instances. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Use Classes?\n",
        "\n",
        "After getting familiar with creating classes we'll write classes that extend the funcationality of existing classes, just like **sharing code**. Obviously, you can store classes in modules and import other programmers' classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However Object Oriented is not about coding classes and organizing your code, it will give you a **new perspective** to see the world and a fresh framework for solving problems. The concepts related to classes will make you think in object oriented logic and get comfortable in using classes for real world problems. Just like *EA in DB*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes can also help you and other programmers **understand the code easily**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use Classes?\n",
        "You can model anything with classes. Let's start with writing a *Dog* 🐶 class which represents dog. As stated before this isn't **the dog**, it is just **a dog**. Now we have a create variables to store their **properties** like name and age. We also know what dogs **do** like running, eating and sitting. These two bits of information and three behaviors will go into our Dog class. Again mimicing behaviors and information of any dog.\n",
